Overview:
As passionate travelers, managing our favorite places across different cities has become a tedious and manual task. This application aims to streamline this process by developing a web application that leverages OpenAI to curate and manage a list of must-see locations in any given city. This user-friendly platform will enhance trip planning by offering efficient access to a city's top destinations.

Your main goals to accomplish are,
Backend Development
A server using Node.js and Express (or a similar framework) to interact with OpenAI's API. This server will retrieve a curated list of popular places to visit in a specified city.
Frontend Development
A user interface using React that allows users to input new places and display the list of favorite places fetched from the server.
Implement functionalities to view details of existing places, and delete entries.
